# Project Overview

This project presents a rigorous statistical analysis of 150 students across three English course levels
(Advanced, Intermediate, Foundation) to validate the effectiveness of The Key's course placement system.
The study examines the relationship between aptitude test scores and actual performance to ensure
students are placed in appropriate learning environments.

## Key Findings

- ✅ **"Highly Significant Differences"**: Clear stratification across all course levels (p < .001)
- ✅ **"Strong Predictive Validity"**: Aptitude scores correlate strongly with performance (r = .887)
- ✅ **"Very Large Effect Sizes"**: All pairwise comparisons show Cohen’s d > 1.2
- ✅ **"System Validation"**: Placement procedures are working excellently


## Research Questions

1. Do students with different performance levels enroll in different course levels?
2. Are there significant differences in aptitude scores across course levels?
3. What is the correlation between aptitude scores and performance?
4. What are the implications for course placement and program quality?
